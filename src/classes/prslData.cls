Application

I applied in-person. The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at Salesforce in April 2016.

Interview

Process took about 4 weeks and the recruitment team was very courteous and extremely organized, kudos to them. First step was a phone screen, which you'll talk about your past experience and current skill set. Next step was a coding exercise; not much pressure here, just complete the exercise when you can. After that, a 1:1 interview with another software engineer; this involves speaking about your background and an online coding exercise, only this time they'll be able to see how you build your solution. If you pass this, you'll enjoy a panel interview which, in my case, consisted of two separate interviews with a mixture of engineers and managers. You'll be discussing your experience and background, behavioral questions, and coding/architecture exercises using a whiteboard. Once you pass all that, you'll get the final director interview; here you'll discuss experience, answer some behavioral questions and career path options. In all stages of interviews, you're always given the chance to ask questions at the end of the interview. Do your research on Salesforce; what they've done; what Marc has done; their involvement with the community; what its like to work at Salesforce; how they've handled growth; really, anything you want, just be engaged and make sure they understand what's important to you in a job.


Interview Questions

Can't discuss specifics, but all coding exercises are done with the language of your choice; the main thing to remember is to just break down the solution. They're looking for how you solve the problem and how you think and aren't too concerned with syntax (except if they're looking for whether you know a specific language).

Negotiation

You should always negotiate.
 

===============================

Application

I applied through other source. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Salesforce.

Interview

The interview process consisted of two phone interviews. The first was an in-depth dive into your resume and more behavioral questions. Some technical questions were asked but pretty basic, just making sure that you understood the main concepts of your courses. The second phone interview was an in-depth technical question. The interviewer was awesome and was definitely looking for your thought process rather than just the right answer. I would highly recommend looking into the different initiatives and what the company culture is like before the call so you can ask questions and show an interest in the company as a whole!
